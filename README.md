# Question

The following description is about the Electonic Dumbwaiter Lift (EDL) used to transport foods and beverages between floors from/to the hotel's default location (kitchen). Your task is to analyse the following specifications and design the EDL controller using digital electronic components and logic gates. Figure Q1 depicts the typical view of the EDL controller.

Specifications of the EDL Controller
1. The hotel owner initially plans to implement the system for three stories (ground floor, first floor, and second floor).
2. Push Buttons are used for selecting the appropriate floor to move the lift from the default location (ground floor kitchen).
3. Limit Switches will be used for identifying the floors when the lift reaches.
4. Return switches are used for sending the EDL to the default location.
5. RESET can be used to reset the EDL system.
